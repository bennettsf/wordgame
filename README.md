# Word Game CS111 Personal Project
Word Game using Django

Recent changes:

- Addition of an ajax statement that checks if the inputed word is an english word or not.
- Functionality of the Django database which creates objects of the word, whether it's a vaild word or not, and the point total for the new word.

The letter buttons are generated using the functions in wordgame.py

My next plan is to introduce functionality (similar to the game boggle) with limitations to how you are able to construct your words as well as minor visual updates!

Create dictionary of already found words. Check if next word has already been found.
